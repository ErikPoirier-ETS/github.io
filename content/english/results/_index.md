## Theoretical Framework

The FdR-BIM performance measurement, impact assessment and benchmarking project adopts a comprehensive, systemic and systematic approach integrating the **Triple Bottom Line** framework (economic, environmental, social) and **ESG** criteria (Environmental, Social, Governance).

{{< figure src="/images/framework-theorique_en.png" alt="Performance measurement theoretical framework" caption="Theoretical framework for performance measurement, impact assessment and benchmarking (Adapted from Rankin et al., 2008)" >}}

The framework considers:
- **Project inputs** — Initial project resources and data
- **Project delivery system** — Orchestrated structures, processes, actors and artifacts
- **Project constraints** (time, cost, etc.) and **organizational constraints** (resources, etc.)
- **Mechanisms** — Competencies/capacity/maturity, use of digital tools, degree of collaboration, other innovations
- **Outcomes** — Environmental, social, economic and other results
- **Impact** — Long-term effects measured through the impact value chain

## Priority Performance Indicators

The following **17 priority measures** have been identified and validated by public owner organizations (POOs) for deployment across all FdR-BIM pilot projects.

| **Cost** | Cost per unit | Average cost per installed unit ($/m², $/km, etc.) |
| **Time** | Duration predictability | Variance between actual duration and initial estimate (%) |
| **Time** | Time per unit | Average installation time per unit |
