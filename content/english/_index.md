    content: "Digital transformation has been promoted as an effective means of supporting major reform in the built assets industry. It aims to improve overall performance and productivity in the construction industry. However:"
    bulletpoints:
      - "The lack of harmonized performance measurement systems is a major obstacle to large-scale digital transformation."
      - "Insufficient data on results and impacts creates uncertainty among public owners and decision-makers."
      - "This uncertainty reduces their willingness to invest in digital initiatives."
      - "Without performance measurement, organizations struggle to: (1) Evaluate their results, (2) Understand performance trajectories, and (3) Identify areas requiring corrective action or improvement."
